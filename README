The purpose of libfixposix is to offer replacements for parts of POSIX
whose behaviour is inconsistent across *NIX flavours.

* Compilation

If you've downloaded this library through git, you'll first need to
generate the ./configure script; in order to do that you need to have
at least autoconf-2.67, automake-1.10, libtool-2.2.6b and check(for
the test suite: see http://check.sf.net) then run this inside the top
directory:
> autoreconf -i -f

For best results use a dedicated build directory instead of running
the configure script directly in the source tree:
> mkdir build ; cd build
> ../libfixposix/configure
> make
> make install

On Linux, you might need to run «ldconfig» as superuser after
installing, otherwise the *nix linker won't be able to find the library
